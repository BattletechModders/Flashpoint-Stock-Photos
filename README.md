# FlashpointStockPhotos
These are a select set of images to be called in group conversations for HBS' BATTLETECH game. The aim is to provide general use images for Flashpoint authors in one repository. This will cut down on duplicated imagery and keep the memory footprint reasonable. Images will ve in .dds format.

This mod is to be used with ConverseTek, files would be referenced in the action to set a viewscreen image.

Currently there are only five images in the database:

screenoff - An empty image, there is not error-free way to clear the screen at this time


audioonly - A modified "lostsignal" image with the words "Audio Only" overlayed for cast members with no need for a custom image


localsrep - For some reason, HBS didn't feel the need to let us chat with him


regionmap - A map of the Rimward Periphery region the stock game takes place in


spheremap - A map of the Inner Sphere for greater context
